= Creating Operations
:toc: left
:experimental:

We are now ready to create and perform actions.

== Creating the operation to permit actions

One operation that we need to create immediately is an operation to grant a permission.

Now that we have our system subject, and our `create-operation` operation, we can call `do-operation`.

`do-operation` is a function that takes the following arguments:

* the subject identifier (in this case, `+https://site.test/_site/subjects/system+`),
* the operation identifier (in this case, `+https://site.test/_site/operations/create-operation+`),
* a document

The actual call to `do-operation` is shown below:

[source,clojure]
----
include::../../src/juxt/site/alpha/init.clj[tag=create-grant-permission-operation!,indent=0]
----

NOTE: We would usually have to grant permission to our system subject for this operation.
However, this permission was already installed in <<bootstrap-install-system-permissions>>.
