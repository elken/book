= Statelessness

Site is a server, accepting requests over HTTP.
Site does not hold on to any state between individual web requests.
Site stores all its state in the XTDB database.

This principle ensures that the database state determines the response to any given request.
The responses to requests are repeatable, if the database state is the same.
