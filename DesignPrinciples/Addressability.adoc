= Addressability

All data in the database is stored as time-varying documents.

_Each and every document in a Site instance is identified by a URI._

URIs are specially constructed to make it possible for them to be act as addresses.
Software is able to route requests to resources solely by using information encoded in the URI.
In this way, all data is potentially addressable over web protocols
With Site, the only restriction to accessing data are access controls.

It is important that URIs are globally unique.
Site insists that URIs are absolute, but provides tooling to ensure that it is easy to migrate resources from one Site instance to another.

****
This principle is still not as popular in data systems as it should be.
Sometimes, the only way of addressing data is by specialist knowledge of a particular application.
Few databases are designed to provide web access to each of their records.

Site rescues this key principle from the early web.
