= Domain Configuration
:toc: left

== Preparation

=== Decide on a fully qualified hostname

Site includes a web server and is designed to be accessed over the network.
Since Site resources are identified by URIs, you should decide on a hostname in a domain that you control.

For the purposes of learning, development and local testing, it is a good idea to use a test hostname, such as `site.test`.
These instructions are written assuming that you've chosen `site.test` as your hostname.
If you're using your own hostname in a domain you control, amend these instructions accordingly.

=== Configure your local DNS or /etc/hosts

To access Site locally for bootstrapping we need to ensure requests to `site.test` are directed to the local service.

Edit /etc/hosts to direct requests for `site.test` and `auth.site.test` to 127.0.0.1.

----
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.
127.0.0.1	localhost site.test auth.site.test
----

=== mkcert

// TODO: Explain why we are doing this

[IMPORTANT]
--
Install mkcert

----
sudo pacman -Sy mkcert
----

Install the root certificate

----
mkcert -install
----

This should result in the following:

----
Created a new local CA 💥
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox and/or Chrome/Chromium trust store (requires browser restart)! 🦊
----

--

=== Install nginx

[IMPORTANT]
--
Install nginx

----
sudo pacman -Sy nginx-mainline
----
--

=== Create private key and cert

[IMPORTANT]
--
Create a new cert for the local development server, and move these into your nginx config directory.

----
mkcert site.test auth.site.test
sudo mv site.test+1.pem /etc/nginx/site.test.pem
sudo mv site.test+1-key.pem /etc/nginx/site.test-key.pem
----
--

=== Configure nginx

[IMPORTANT]
--
Configure nginx.
Use `etc/dev/nginx.conf` as a guide to what to configure.
You'll need to reference your private key and cert via the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` parameters.

----
ssl_certificate      site.test.pem;
ssl_certificate_key  site.test-key.pem;
----

You'll need to increase the size of request bodies you can send through nginx, the default is too restrictive.

----
client_max_body_size 16M;
----

You'll also need to configure the details of your the origin server (Site).

----
http {
  ...
  client_max_body_size 16M;
  ...
  server {
    ...
    ssl_certificate site.test.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key site.test-key.pem;
    ...
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:2021;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
----

Test your final configuration before you start nginx and fix any errors.

----
sudo nginx -t
----
--

=== Start nginx

[IMPORTANT]
--
Start nginx

----
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
----
--

== Install Site

=== Clone the Site repo

[IMPORTANT]
--
Clone the Site git repo

----
$ git clone https://github.com/juxt/site
----
--

== Configure the Site service

=== Install the configuration file

There's a sample configuration in `etc` you should copy to `$HOME/.config/site/config.edn`.

----
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/site
$ cp site/etc/config.edn $HOME/.config/site/config.edn
----

WARNING: If you're aren't using `site.test` as a hostname, edit the configuration to replace `https://site.test` with the URI that corresponds to the hostname you have chosen.

== Start the Site server

[IMPORTANT]
--
Start the Site server:

----
$ site/bin/site-server
----

Alternatively, if you're familiar with Clojure development, you can start the server via the `deps.edn` file and simply 'jack-in' with your editor or IDE as normal.
--

////

(should retain this somewhere else)

=== Start multiple instances of the server

If you require multiple Site servers to coexist on the same machine, you can start site passing a different configuration file as follows:

----
$ SITE_CONFIG=/absolute/path/custom-site-config.edn site/bin/site-server
----

In this case please be sure to change the configuration so ports are different and XTDB files are stored in a separate folder than the ones specified in the example configuration file.
You'll also need to specify Site host:port when using site commands, for example:

----
$ SITE_BASE_URI=http://localhost:5509 site/bin/site get-token -u admin
----
////

== Connect to Site's REPL

If you've run Site via your development environment and 'jacked-in' you'll already have a REPL. Proceed to the next step.

If you're running Site with `site/bin/site-server`, you'll need to connect a terminal to Site to access the REPL.
You can do this via port `50505`, which is a socket REPL that Site starts by default.

How you connect to this port is up to you. One way is via `ncat`, but you can replace `ncat` with `telnet`, or `netcat`, depending on what's available for your system.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Arch users can install `ncat` by installing the `nmap` package:

----
$ sudo pacman -Sy nmap
----
--

[IMPORTANT]
--
Connect to Site's REPL:

----
$ ncat localhost 50505
----
--

[TIP]
--
Alternatively, prefix the command with `rlwrap` if you have it installed.

----
$ rlwrap ncat localhost 50505
----
--

=== Introducing Site's REPL

----
Site by JUXT. Copyright (c) 2021, JUXT LTD.
Type :repl/quit to exit

site>
----

[TIP]
--
There are a few useful Site REPL commands you should be familiar with:

(ls):: List all resources
(ls <pat>):: List all resources whose URIs match the pattern
(evict! <uri>+):: Kill resource(s) across time
(put! <doc>+)):: Put one or more resources into the database
(factory-reset!):: Start over. (Delete everything in the database!)
--

[[bootstrap]]
== Bootstrap

Now we are ready to bootstrap the system by installing a collection of base entities.

[TIP]
--
You can view the entities in your database with the following:

----
user> (ls)
----

If the database is not empty, you can clear it with:

----
user> (factory-reset!)
----
--

TIP: Alternatively, you can delete the database directory `db` in `$HOME/.local/share/site`.

Ensure that the database is empty. Now install the entities:

[IMPORTANT]
--
From the REPL, install the four primordial entities with the following:

----
user> (bootstrap!)
----

If this is successful, run `(ls)` to check the four entities have been installed.

This will look similar to:

----
("https://site.test/_site/events/4"
 "https://site.test/_site/events/5"
 "https://site.test/_site/events/6"
 "https://site.test/_site/events/7"
 "https://site.test/_site/events/8"
 "https://site.test/_site/events/9"
 "https://site.test/_site/do-operation"
 "https://site.test/_site/not-found"
 "https://site.test/_site/operations/create-operation"
 "https://site.test/_site/operations/get-not-found"
 "https://site.test/_site/operations/grant-permission"
 "https://site.test/_site/operations/install-not-found"
 "https://site.test/_site/permissions/get-not-found"
 "https://site.test/_site/permissions/system/bootstrap"
 "https://site.test/_site/permissions/system/install-not-found"
 "https://site.test/_site/subjects/system")

== (Old instructions)

NOTE: We're keeping these instructions as they're useful if you want
to configure a reverse-proxy with proper hostnames.

If you're really keen, you can try out Site and use Swagger UI as a test client.
Follow these instructions:

. Install nginx - see link:doc/next/Installation.adoc[]
. `git clone https://github.com/juxt-site/swagger-ui`
. Install `mkcert` as per link:doc/next/Installation.adoc[]
. Create a cert: `mkcert data.site.test auth.site.test`
. Create a separate cert for the Swagger UI client: `mkcert swagger-ui.site.test`
. Move the generated certs (and associated key files) to your `/etc/nginx/` directory.
. Add the following sub-section to the `http` section of your `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file
+
----
    server {
        listen       443 ssl;
        server_name  data.site.test auth.site.test;

        ssl_certificate      data.site.test+1.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key  data.site.test+1-key.pem;

        ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
        ssl_session_timeout  5m;

        ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

        location / {
           proxy_pass	http://localhost:2021;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
----
. Add the following sub-section to the `http` section of your `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file
+
----
    server {
        listen       443 ssl;
        server_name  swagger-ui.site.test;

        ssl_certificate      swagger-ui.site.test.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key  swagger-ui.site.test-key.pem;

        ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
        ssl_session_timeout  5m;

        ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

        location / {
	  # Replace this with the absolute path of the dist subdir of the swagger-ui clone
	  root swagger-ui/dist/;
        }
    }
----
. As noted, replace the `swagger-ui/dist/` line with the right location on your system.
. Make sure the `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key` entries match the filenames of your cert and key files.
. Check nginx config with `nginx -t` first, which will also check the filenames are correct
. Start nginx, e.g. `sudo systemctl start nginx`
. Start a REPL using the provided deps.edn in the usual way.
. Go to the file `src/juxt/site/repl.clj` and search for `:openid/register-user`. Edit the settings there according to your GitHub username.
. From the REPL, enter `(init)`. Alternatively, `rlwrap ncat localhost 50505` and type `:init` - this step will require network access as it downloads issuer configuration and keys.
. Browse to https://swagger-ui.site.test/
. Click on the green `Authorize` button
. Initially this will redirect you to Auth0. Click on the Github icon which will take you to Github. You'll need to allow Github to authorize Auth0 to access your basic profile details. These are used to match the identity you've registered with `:open/register-user`.
. You should now be able to 'try out' the API operations in the Swagger UI.
