= Using the site command-line tool
:toc: left

In this chapter, we'll use the *site* tool to called the System API of the Site instance we've started.

== Acquiring a bearer token

Before the *site* tool can access our Site instance's System API, it needs to acquire a bearer token.
From the configuration we established, the token is saved to `$HOME/.curlrc`.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Acquire and store a bearer token:

----
site request-token
----
--

This should output something similar to the following:

----
Reading client-secret from $HOME/.cache/site/default/client-secrets/site-cli
Bearer token saved to $HOME/.curlrc
Access token expires in 86400 seconds
----

You can display the token with the following:

----
site check-token
----

This should return a JSON object containing a property for `"bearer-token"`.

// Local Variables:
// mode: outline
// outline-regexp: "[=]+"
// End:
