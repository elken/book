= Bootstrapping the System API
:toc: left

In this chapter we will add just enough resources to Site's database to build up a working 'System API'.

Once we have built this API we can continue to configure Site remotely by using an API client.

== Resetting the system

Clear out any existing resources from Site.
This isn't strictly necessary if you haven't installed Site before, but is worth knowing in case you want to start over.

----
site reset
----

== Bootstrapping

Next we must bootstrap Site by deploying a minimal set of resources.
We do this by calling `site bundle` to prepare a list of resources to install and sending this, via **curl**, to our Site instance.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Bootstrap your Site instance:

----
site bundle juxt/site/bootstrap | curl -K $SITE_HOME/install.curl
----
--

The resources that are installed are the minimal set that will allow us to create operations and grant permissions to use them.

****
Whenever you like, you can inspect your Site instance's resources with `ls`:

----
site ls
----

This will bring up a list of all the resources in the database allowing you to narrow your search.

You can also narrow your search by providing a filter on the command line:

----
site ls operations
----
****

== Adding API support

In Site, resources are created by calling operations.
We must add the operations needed to build an API:

[IMPORTANT]
--
Install the `juxt/site/api-operations` group:

----
site bundle juxt/site/api-operations | curl -K $SITE_HOME/install.curl
----
--

== Install the System API

Site can be configured remotely, via its own API, which we need to install now.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Install the Site System API

----
site bundle juxt/site/system-api | curl -K $SITE_HOME/install.curl
----
--

== Configure Site to issue bearer tokens

We must now add an endpoint that an API client can call to be authorized to call our System API.
This endpoint is called a 'token endpoint' because it issues access tokens to authorized clients to use in API requests.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Install a token endpoint for issuing bearer tokens:

----
site bundle juxt/site/oauth-token-endpoint | curl -K $SITE_HOME/install.curl
----
--

By default, access tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
These are cryptographically signed.
We must install a keypair that Site can use to sign the JWTs that it will issue.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Install a new keypair:

----
site new-keypair | curl -K $SITE_HOME/install.curl
----
--

****
You can also use `site new-keypair` whenever you want to rotate the keypair.
Existing keypairs will be retained in the database in order to verify access tokens that have been signed in the past.
****

== Register applications

Before an application is allowed to access an API of a Resource Server, it must first be registered as a client.

=== site-cli

The `site` command-line tool can work against the System API remotely.
In order to do o, we must register it with our Site instance.
We register it with the `client_id` set to `site-cli`.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Register the command-line application:

----
site bundle juxt/site/system-client --client-id site-cli \
| curl -K $SITE_HOME/install.curl
----
--

=== InSite

There is also a web application, called *InSite*, which can be used in preference to the command line tool.

[IMPORTANT]
--
Register the *InSite* application:

----
site bundle juxt/site/system-client --client-id insite \
| curl -K $SITE_HOME/install.curl
----
--

// Local Variables:
// mode: outline
// outline-regexp: "[=]+"
// End:

== Extract the client secret of an API client

Each of the applications we have registered will have a unique _client secret_.
Until we have added user accounts, we will have to use this client secret in order to authorize the application to call the System API.
Therefore, we must extract the client secret for the application we want to use.

For example, if we want to use the *InSite* web application, we must give it its unique `client_secret`:

----
site client-secret insite
----

This will return a special string of characters that we can give to *InSite* when we connect it to our Site instance.

If we give a `--save` option, it will save the `client_secret` to a temporary area known to the site-cli script (usually `$HOME/.cache/site/client-secrets/site-cli`).

[IMPORTANT]
--
Extract the client secret for this `site-cli` and save it to a temporary area:

----
site client-secret --save site-cli
----
--
