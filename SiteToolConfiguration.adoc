= Site tool configuration
:toc: left

Before we can run the `site` tool, we must ensure that it is correctly configured.

[WARNING]
--
The `site` command line tool is configured separately from a Site instance.

<<site-cli-edn-config>> shows an example configuration file in EDN format.
The advantage of EDN is that it is possible to use https://github.com/juxt/aero[Aero] _tag literals_ to access environment variables, reduce duplication and alter configuration depending on a 'profile' setting.
