= Form-Based Authentication
:toc: left
:experimental:

== Introduction

In this chapter we'll create a login form that will allow a user access to a
protected resource.

We'll need to create the following resources:

. A document at `+https://site.test/protected-by-session-scope/document.html+`
which requires the User can perform the Operation
`+https://site.test/operations/get-protected-resource+`. We'll called this the
_protected document_. This is explained in <<create-resource-protected-by-session-scope>>.

. A Permission to allow Alice to access this protected document. This is added
in <<grant-permission-to-resource-protected-by-session-scope>>.

. A Session Scope that redirects unauthenticated requests when necessary. This is
added in <<create-session-scope>>.

. A login form that will be shown to the User, allowing them to
authenticate. We'll also want this resource to handle the POST request that
occurs when a User submits the login formfootnote:[Keeping the resource the same is convenient because it means we don't have to worry about the value of the form's `operation` attribute.]. This is created in
<<create-login-resource>>.

. An Operation that can be used when the POST request is received. This Operation will
attempt to find a User Identity that matches some received credentials. If one
if found, the Operation will create a Subject in the database.

. A User Identity for Alice, including a username/password pair, that Alice can use
to authenticate using the form. This is added in <<session-scope-add-user-identity>>.

<<session-scope-flow>> shows the interaction between the components.

In <<session-scope-flow>>, the following steps are illustrated:

. Alice enters a URI (or clicks on a link) to browse a document.

. The browser sends a GET request to the protected document:
`+https://site.test/protected-by-session-scope/document.html+`.

. The operation is associated with the Operation
`+https://site.test/operations/get-protected-resource+` and a check is made for a
permission to perform this Operation.

. No permission is matched, the request is denied.

. In denying the request, a session scope is looked up.

. One is found and returned, associated with the URI of a login form.

. A `302 Found` response is send containing a `Location` header of the URI of
the login form.

. The browser redirects to the URI contained in the `Location` header of the
previous response (in this case, `/login.html`).

. The URI locates a resource which returns the HTML of a login form, with an
`operation` attribute containing the URI of a resource that will handle the
credentials (in this case, `/login`).

. Alice enters her credentials and clicks btn:[Submit].

. The browser makes a POST request to the resource identified by the form's
`operation` attribute, with a body that contains the credentials.

. The Operation associated with the POST method on this resource is looked up
(`+https://site.test/operations/login+`). The system searches for a permission to
perform this Operation.

. Since the login form is intended as a public resource, a permission is found
to exist and the request is allowed to proceed.

. The `+https://site.test/operations/login+` Operation is performed.

. All actions are run as transaction functions in XTDB in order to guarantee
database consistency and preserve a deterministic log of serialized
transactions. The `+https://site.test/operations/login+` Operation contains a
procedural 'program' which is run inside the transaction function.

. One of the first steps of the procedure is to find a User Identity that
matches the credentials received in the request body.

. A matching User Identity exists for Alice which is returned, otherwise the
procedure throws an error and the transaction aborts.

. (create subject, session, session-token)

. (associate session token in log entry)

. (set-cookie corresponding to session)

. (302 found)

. (get original resource)

. (check permission)

. (approved)

. (200 OK)
