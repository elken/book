== Adding users

Now we have authorized access to the System API, we can start to add users.

We can view the list of users with the following:

----
curl http://localhost:4444/_site/users
----

To create a user we need to craft a JSON object that contains a username, but can contain any other data as necessary. See <<ex-create-a-user>> for an example.

[[ex-create-a-user]]
.Creating a user
****
Using *jo* we can create the necessary JSON for a user with username `alice`:

----
jo username=alice fullname="Alice Carroll"
----

Now we can create a user by piping this JSON into *curl*:

----
jo username=alice fullname="Alice Carroll" password=$(gum input --password) | curl --json @- http://localhost:4444/_site/users
----

We can check check this has worked by checking the list of users:

----
curl http://localhost:4444/_site/users
----


****

[IMPORTANT]
--
Create a few users as shown in <<ex-create-a-user>>.
