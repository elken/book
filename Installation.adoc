* https://curl.se/[curl]
* A webserver such as Apache or Nginx

== Before you start

* All these instructions are for Arch Linux, please amend accordingly for your own platform, if different.

* Run each command under your user account (i.e. not as root).

* For documentation purposes, we'll assume your Site server will be set up to run on the host `site.test`.
If you choose another hostname, or are setting up for production, please amend these instructions accordingly.
