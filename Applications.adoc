== Introduction

Operations are invoked when users make direct requests to an API. However, APIs are
primarily designed to be used by applications acting on a user's behalf.

Applications must first be registered with Site. Then a user must authorize an
application to access an API on their behalf. Only then can an application
request a time-limited access token-from Site which it can present when making
API requests.

=== Scope

Operations can be grouped together into access ranges. For example, the actions required for user administration might be grouped into an access range named `user:admin`.

Applications might only need a limited set of these access ranges in order to function.
The allowed access ranges might be restricted during application registration.

A set of these access ranges is called a *scope*.

An example scope might be `"user:admin resources:read resources:write"`.

During the application authorization step, the authorizing user might choose to restrict the scope of access ranges an application can acquire.

Furthermore, applications might unilaterally request a restricted scope upon requesting an access token.

No matter the ultimate scope of the access-token that is issued, an application cannot use an access-token to invoke an operation that would otherwise be unavailable to a user.
