== Introduction

The use of cookies provide an alternative approach to user authentication.

== Session scopes

Site introduces the concept of a _session scopes_ which are conceptually similar
to protection spaces, described in <<protection-spaces>>.

A session scope covers a set of resources. If a request to a resource within this
set is made without a session containing valid credentials, and the request
cannot be authorized, then the request is redirected to another location. This
other location is a resource which will presumably establish a session
containing valid credentials before redirecting back to the original resource
for another try. Note, there is no guarentee that the new request will be
authorized, since the user identified by the credentials may not be permitted to
access the resource.

[CAUTION]
--

Session scopes are not standard nor specified by an RFC, but are implemented by
Site to support session-based authentication commonly used on the Web.

== Preparing the creation of session scopes

To create a session scope, we first need to establish an Operation that will allow
us to do so. As always, the Operation specifies which attributes are required and
their values. <<ex-create-operation-put-session-scope>> demonstrates the creation of
such an Operation.

We must also ensure our REPL user has permission to call this Operation.

[IMPORTANT]
--

Copy the code in <<ex-create-operation-put-session-scope>> into a REPL, edit as
necessary and evaluate.
